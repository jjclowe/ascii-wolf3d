Can Node.js do 3D?

Well no, not really.  But it can do 2.5D!

This is a Node.js implementation of billboard rendering from 2D projection maps, a technique pioneered by games like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).

Inspired by OneLoneCoder's C++ video: [First Person Shooter (Quick and Simple C++)
